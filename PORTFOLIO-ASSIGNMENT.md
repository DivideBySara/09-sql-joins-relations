# Portfolio Assignment for Class 9 - Code Review

Work in pairs to improve your portfolio.

Follow a git flow somewhat similar to our lab. Start by forking each other's portfolios.

Start with code review. Spend the first 30 minutes looking over your partner's portfolio code. Look for opportunities to improve the code base according to the best practices and concepts that we've covered in class so far.

Remember, good code review:
 - Focuses on the code, not the author
 - Asks "Why is it this way?" rather than criticizing; seek to understand
 - Will nitpick the details
 - Seeks to make the code more understandable
 - Embraces and congratulates best practices
 - Respects the work that went into the current product

Create descriptive issues for the most important issues that should be addressed. In the issue, describe what you see, ask clarifying questions as needed, and link to the related line of code in the repo.

Once you both have a few issues logged, start writing code together.

The Driver will work on the Navigator's codebase. The Navigator can talk them through what is where, and how changes should be made, and the Driver can implement them. When an issue is complete, the Driver should push the changes to a branch on their fork, do a PR from their fork's branch to their fork's master, and then merge the branch.

Switch after you've worked through a few issues. Switch back again (and again) if time allows. When you are done, each person should send a PR from their fork's master to the upstream repo.
